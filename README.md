# deeptour_lib

Code for a project for the (https://devrevhack0.devpost.com/)[DevRev hackathon].

To run it you need to install requirements.txt and then python3 deeptour.py /project/path/here

On the first run it can take some time because it will be downloading the models to use when generating the tours.

Be prepared to do some, possibly a lot of firefighting to get this working on your machine.
